Most activity with your photo will happen in the first few hours, so make those hours count. Here's when you should post your photos: 1.Post them during the middle of the day during the week, when people are likely to be bored at work and surfing the web. Don't post them too early in the morning, or around five or six o'clock, or people will be too busy commuting to notice your photos. 2.Post your photos a little bit after dinner time. People tend to browse the web when they're tired in the evening. 3.Post your photos during special occasions. Halloween, Christmas, and Valentine's Day are popular times to post photos. Even though people should be too busy celebrating to notice your photos, they will actually be more likely to check them out.",
